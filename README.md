# Forward-Deployed AI at Institutional Scale

## Overview

This repository documents the work and methodology of **Philippe Küng**, a Forward-Deployed AI Architect dedicated to upgrading the world's most critical institutions — sovereign governments, energy grids, and healthcare systems.

The core mission is to translate complex operational challenges into **production-grade AI**, owning the outcome from initial specification to global deployment.

## 🧬 The Forward-Deployed DNA

The approach combines five key pillars:

- **Technical Foundation:** Production engineering honed at Crayon AG and MIT.  
- **Emerging Tech:** Expertise in LLMs, agentic systems, and state-of-the-art innovation.  
- **Team Integration:** Seamless on-site embedding with client teams.  
- **Domain Fluency:** Deep vertical expertise in Energy, Finance, and Healthcare.  
- **Startup Spirit:** Lean product development and rapid ROI focus.

## 🛠 Framework for On-Site Execution

- **On-Site Immersion:** Mapping "unwritten rules" and workflow friction points.  
- **Technical Specification:** Translating qualitative bottlenecks into engineering KPIs.  
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Iterative loops: *Talk to users → Write code → Test → Repeat.*

## 📈 Evidence of Impact

### 1. Modernizing the National Grid (NTE)
Architected a cloud-native data warehouse on Azure Synapse integrating real-time industrial sensor data for grid monitoring.  
**Outcome:** Enabled fact-based governance for critical national infrastructure.

### 2. Sovereign-Level Compliance (DNV)
Developed **DATE** (Digital Access to Experts), an NLP engine for vessel certification inquiries.  
**Outcome:** 82% automation of inquiries, saving approximately **$200k annually**.

### 3. Healthcare Quality & Safety Audits
Built a **Semantic Search** solution on AKS to match auditor observations to accreditation standards.  
**Outcome:** Significantly reduced surveyor errors and audit time.

## 🚀 Engineering the Technology Frontier

### Project Guardian: Advanced RAG
Linking incident reports to **16,000 HSE controls** for the Downer Group.  
**Impact:** 80% accuracy in identifying safety controls in seconds.

### Project Chimera: Multi-Agent Automation
Developed a **multi-agent framework** for financial compliance (FinSA, AML, KYC).  
**Impact:** 60% reduction in manual portfolio review time.

### Project Citadel: Production-Grade LLM Ops
Deployed secure, air-gapped **generative AI** for a National Ministry of Economic Development.  
**Impact:** Ensured sovereign data control with **high-performance 70B parameter models**.
